# Vendored ISO 20022 Schemas

These XSD files are the official ISO 20022 message schemas published by
ISO20022.org and republished under MIT license by the phoughton/pyiso20022
project on GitHub. They are vendored here to enable XSD-based validation
and xsdata-driven Pydantic model generation without requiring users of
pactus-mcp to register with iso20022.org.

### A note on hashes and line endings

The SHA-256 hashes below are computed against the files exactly as vendored,
including their original CRLF line endings as published upstream. The
`.gitattributes` file pins `*.xsd` as `binary` so git will preserve these
bytes byte-for-byte across all platforms. To verify a hash locally on any
OS: `sha256sum src/pactus/schemas/pacs.008.001.08.xsd`.

## Build pipeline integrity

The vendored XSDs are the start of a cryptographically verified chain from
upstream schema files to passing tests:

1. **XSD provenance** — the four `.xsd` files in this directory are pinned
   to a specific commit of `phoughton/pyiso20022` (see Provenance above)
   and their SHA-256 hashes are documented in the table.
2. **Code generation** — `scripts/generate_models.py` runs xsdata against
   the vendored XSDs and writes Pydantic V2 models to
   `src/pactus/generated/`. The generated `*.py` files are intentionally
   not committed; they are reproducible from the XSDs.
3. **Generated output verification** — the canonical SHA-256 hashes of
   the generated files (computed on Linux, the CI platform of record)
   are committed in `src/pactus/generated/GENERATED_HASHES.txt`. CI
   regenerates the files on every run and verifies them against this
   hash file with `sha256sum -c`.

Any link in this chain that breaks fails CI loudly. To deliberately
update the canonical hashes (e.g. after upgrading xsdata or replacing a
vendored XSD), regenerate locally on Linux, copy the new `sha256sum`
output into `GENERATED_HASHES.txt`, and commit alongside whatever caused
the change. CI will then verify against the new canonical output.

## Updating

To update a schema to a new version:
1. Identify the new pinned commit SHA from phoughton/pyiso20022.
2. Download the new file, compute SHA-256, replace the file and the hash
   in this table.
3. Re-run xsdata generation: `uv run xsdata generate src/pactus/schemas --config .xsdata.xml`
4. Update the curated domain models in `src/pactus/core/domain.py` if
   field structures changed.
5. Bump the pinned commit SHA in this file's "Provenance" section if
   updating multiple files at once.

## Why we vendor instead of fetching at runtime

XSD compilation requires the full schema graph on disk. Vendoring makes
the build hermetic and reproducible — same source SHA, same hashes, same
generated models. Runtime fetching would introduce network dependency,
non-determinism, and a supply-chain attack surface.
