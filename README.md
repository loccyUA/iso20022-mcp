# Pactus

[![CI](https://github.com/deniskarlinsky/iso20022-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/deniskarlinsky/iso20022-mcp/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pactus-mcp.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pactus-mcp/)

Pactus is an MCP server for parsing ISO 20022 payment messages directly from chat. It exposes five tools that let AI assistants inspect `pacs.008`, `pacs.002`, `pain.001`, and `camt.053` messages — the message types at the centre of the CBPR+ migration — without leaving the conversation. It is aimed at developers and bank-integration teams who need to read, debug, or explain ISO 20022 traffic during the transition away from MT messages.

## Status

Stable. Version 1.0.0 is on PyPI.

```bash
pip install pactus-mcp
# or
uv add pactus-mcp
```

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deniskarlinsky/iso20022-mcp
cd iso20022-mcp
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

## Connecting to Claude Desktop

Install via uvx for zero-setup use, or run from a local checkout for development.

Add Pactus to your Claude Desktop config:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### From PyPI (recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pactus": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["pactus-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### From a local clone (for development)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pactus": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/absolute/path/to/iso20022-mcp", "pactus-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The Pactus tools will appear in the tools menu.

## Available tools

| Tool | Message type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ping` | — | Health check; returns service name and version. |
| `parse_pacs008` | `pacs.008.001.08` | Parse a FI-to-FI Customer Credit Transfer. |
| `parse_pacs002` | `pacs.002.001.10` | Parse a FI-to-FI Payment Status Report. |
| `parse_pain001` | `pain.001.001.09` | Parse a Customer Credit Transfer Initiation. |
| `parse_camt053` | `camt.053.001.08` | Parse a Bank-to-Customer Account Statement. |

All four parse tools return a structured Pydantic model on success, or `{"error": "..."}` on failure. Errors never raise; the agent can explain what went wrong.

## Tool reference

### parse_pacs008

`pacs.008` is the primary interbank credit transfer message and the mandatory format for all CBPR+ cross-border traffic from November 2025. It carries one or more credit transfer instructions between financial institutions, each with settlement amount, charge bearer, debtor, and creditor agents.

    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

### parse_pacs002

`pacs.002` is the status report sent in response to a `pacs.008`. It reports whether each transaction was accepted, rejected, or is in an intermediate state. Rejections carry one or more structured reason codes (e.g. `AC01` incorrect account, `AG01` transaction forbidden) that explain the outcome.

    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

### parse_pain001

`pain.001` is the initiating message in a credit transfer flow, sent by a corporate or customer to their bank. It groups transactions into one or more `PaymentInformation` batches that share a debtor account, execution date, and service level. The LLM sees the full hierarchy: group header → batches → transactions.

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### parse_camt053

`camt.053` is the structured account statement sent by a bank to its customer. It reports opening and closing balances and individual debit/credit entries for a period, each optionally broken down to individual transaction details. It is the primary source for automated bank reconciliation.

## Security model

- **XXE and entity-expansion hardening:** All four parsers reject input containing `<!DOCTYPE>` or `<!ENTITY>` declarations before any XML parsing occurs. This blocks XXE file-read, SSRF, and billion-laughs DoS patterns.
- **Build integrity:** Generated xsdata models are SHA-256 verified in CI on every commit (`sha256sum -c GENERATED_HASHES.txt`). Regeneration is reproducible from the vendored XSDs.
- **Supply chain:** GitHub Actions workflows use SHA-pinned action references (commit-hash `@` pins, not mutable tags).
- **Distribution integrity:** PyPI artifacts are published via OIDC Trusted Publishing and signed with Sigstore. SBOMs (CycloneDX and SPDX) are generated and vulnerability-scanned on every CI run; release artifacts include the SBOM.
- **Vulnerability disclosure:** See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Architecture

Pactus uses a hexagonal layout: `pactus/core/` is pure business logic with no MCP awareness, `mcp_server.py` is a thin FastMCP wrapper, and the generated xsdata models live in `pactus/generated/` and never escape `parsers.py`. See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the diagram.

## Development

```bash
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
```

The project targets `mypy --strict`.
